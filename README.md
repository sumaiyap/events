## How to Contribute

I have created a few issue as starting points. You can confer also the aforementioned repos and blog posts. The contributors will be mentioned on the end result.

Some recommendations:

- Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript wherever possible (e.g. for the Express backend).
- Try to use test-driven development (TDD).
- Try to use consistent commit messages, e.g. take a look at [this article](https://itnext.io/ten-commandments-of-git-commit-messages-94bd6dcf6e0e).

The directory structure should be as follows:

```
.
├── 📁 backend
├── 📁 frontend
├── 📄 docker-compose.yaml
└── 📄 README
```
